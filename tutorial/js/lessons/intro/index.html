            <h1>Introduction To JavaScript</h1>
            <p class="main">
                For those of you who have never programmed before, welcome! JavaScript is a type of language 
                different from the likes of C++ or Java. It is called a <em>scripting language</em>, which is 
                a simpler language that is used to make programs do something, rather than create programs from 
                the ground up. This type of programming is great to get people started, as well as being very 
                useful in it's own way.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                JavaScript is a language that is widely used in websites, from hobbyists like me to huge 
                companies, such as Google or Microsoft. It can turn boring old website code that does not a 
                whole lot into shiny interactive experiences. In fact, this website is an example of JavaScript 
                at work!
            </p>
            <p class="main note">
                In this tutorial, I will assume that you have at least a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, as 
                that is how JavaScript (JS for short) is implemented in websites.
            </p>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p class="main">
                To put some JavaScript into a website, you will need to have a HTML page to display the result 
                upon. Let's make one now, like so:
            </p>
            <pre class="main code">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
    &lt;title>A Webpage&lt;/title>
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" />
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
    &lt;p>A Paragraph&lt;/p>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>
            <p class="main">
                There are two ways of implementing JavaScript into a page. One way is by placing the script 
                directly into the page with <code>script</code> tags like this:
            </p>
            <pre class="main code">
&lt;script> alert("Hello, world!"); &lt;/script>
</pre>
            <p class="main note">
                All you need to know about the code above is that it displays a message to the user that 
                looks like <a href="javascript:alert('Hello, world!');">this</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Alternatively, you can load scripts from another file by using the <code>src</code> attribute 
                on the <code>script</code> tag. JavaScript is plain text like HTML, so JS files can be edited in 
                a text editor. The files have an extension of <code>.js</code>.
            </p>
            <pre class="main code">
&lt;script src="myjavascript.js">&lt;/script>
</pre>
            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            <p class="main">
                How you write your code is very important, as your program may not know what to do if you don't 
                follow a set of rules called <strong>syntax</strong>. This is kind of like grammar in English - 
                not following these rules could lead the reader to be confused (in this case, the program). 
                Here is some example code to show some common syntax rules:
            </p>
            <pre class="main code">
// Returns the numbers that go into the specified number.
function divisors(num) {
	if (num > 10e7) {
		return "Nope!";
	} else {
		var divisors = [];
		for (i = 1; i &lt;= num / 2; i++) {
			if (num % i == 0) {
				divisors.push(i);
			}
		}
		divisors.push(num);
		return divisors;
	}
}            
</pre>
            <p class="main note">
                This is a piece of code that can be repeated over and over again from different places (a function). 
                It gives you a bunch of numbers that are the divisors of the number you give it.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                An important syntax rule to learn now is to end every line with a semicolon (";"). This prevents 
                the program from thinking that a line of your script is in the wrong place. You don't need to do 
                this on every line however, only on lines that don't start a block (marked with "{}"). There are 
                also special places where semicolons are used, but don't worry about it now.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                Notice how every bracket "()" and block "{}" are closed in this sample, even if it is on another 
                line? This is of paramount importance, as the program will not know where your code is if you 
                ignore this rule.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                
            </p>
            <p class="main">
            </p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p class="main">
                This has been a quick introduction to JavaScript. To quickly clear up a misconception - no, 
                JavaScript (the scripting language) is not related in anyway to Java (the programming language), 
                except for some syntax. Fun fact, JavaScript is actually a derivative language of ECMAScript, 
                developed for the same purpose.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                In the next tutorial, we will write our first JavaScript and get introduced to programming basics.
