<strong>Warning: </strong>the following is the result of high levels of sleep deprivation and apathy. Don't 
take it as a tell-all insight into my life. That <em>sad</em> time of the month.
</p><p class="main">
The one thing that has suprised me about this is the length of time it has been going on, counting my blessings and 
counting more carefully my mistakes, just manifesting in varying ways. It could just be a hard hour. Of course, I've 
never told anyone about this, but I want it on my website for no reason whatsoever. Contradicting hypocrisy, you might 
say.
</p><p class="main">
I know it's going to get better. A whole lot better. I'm just tired and alone. It has a strange way of messing with 
people, and I've been messed with before, and it's going to happen again.
</p><p class="main">
What I have managed to do and become interested in is nothing that my peers have done, or appreciated, so far. 
My modesty is a core personality trait and also the reason I do these sad things - nobody respects what I do because 
I don't try to get my work and my message out there. Yet when I try and look upon myself to present my work, I put 
myself down again. A vicious cycle borne of my habits, my lifestyle and my upbringing.
</p><p class="main">
I feel unaccomplished. Proud for what I haven't done. A self-destructing work ethic combined with a lost mind. 
Hope feels like an illusion. I'm at a turning point in my life - a rift - starting my second year of high school 
and the fourteenth year of my lifetime. Last year was a more than a challenge. I expected it to be hard, but it 
instead revealed my attitude towards effort and life in general. I look back at what I've done and say "Good, but 
I can do much better than that." It seems that I look back at my progress and disregard it for failure.
</p><p class="main">
I believe I have done brilliantly, and have spectacularly failed at the same time. I've always felt my mind divided - 
the same side that is behind my work and my modesty is also the side most willing to fail. The other side is my 
lifestyle, looking down in apathy. I've always wanted to be ahead of the rest, and the most likely to help others. A 
melting pot of conflicting ideals. On one hand, I've set the bar ever so higher in regards to "intelligence" and 
"integrity". At the same time, I'm ever so helplessly tripping and falling over the same bar.
