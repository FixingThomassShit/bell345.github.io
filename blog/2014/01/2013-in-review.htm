	What. A. Year. 2013 was certainly one of my most life-changing years I've ever had at least. 
	I started the year with no idea of what I'd become. High school has changed my life and the 
	way I view myself and the world around me. It's hard to believe that I was even the same person 
	12 months ago. I'd met new friends, learnt so much more, and improved myself over these tumultuous 
	months. But personally, I think you'd like to hear about current events instead. So - <br />
	<strong>What happened this year?</strong>
</p>
<p class="main">
	In January, not much happened really. Or that's what <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013">
	Wikipedia</a> tells me anyway. February saw the pope's resignation, the first to do so since 
	1294, and a big space rock explodes over Russia (just your average day). Also, we get more 
	proof that North Korea is officially insane, because they conduct another nuclear test.
</p>
<p class="main">
	The next month, Pope Francis is elected to be everybody's favourite pope. North Korea 
	continues to escalate the crazy, by threatening several countries, including the US, 
	Japan and South Korea, despite knowing fully that America will probably bomb the place 
	immediately. Scientists continue to do more cool stuff with 3D printing, and the Higgs 
	Boson's existence is finally confirmed.
</p>
<p class="main">
	On the 6th of June, Edward Snowden discloses a US mass surveillance program to international 
	media, then flees the country. Julia Gillard decides to resign as Aussie PM (finally) and 
	then Kevin Rudd replaces her as party leader and PM. Croatia joins the EU. Everybody freaks 
	out over the new royal baby (come on, he's like 3rd in line).
</p>
<p class="main">
	Then Egyptians continue to disagree strongly with each other, Shanghai can no longer  
	breathe, and the Phillipines get very, very wet. All in all, not very good. China lands a  
	spacecraft on the moon (after two other tries) and Mandela passes away.
</p>
<p class="main">
	It still shocks me that we're in 2014 (the future is here), and that 1990 is now 24 years 
	ago (the past isn't anymore). As I am forgetful by nature, the only thing I can remember right 
	now is what I got for Christmas. I treated myself to some games on the Steam sales and a month 
	of Spotify Premium. The rest is being saved up, because I'm indecisive like that. Above all, 
	I am constantly realising that I am being born into an age of huge progress and surprising 
	pacifism. After all, last century had two world wars, one after the 
	other, and the rest were filled with ignorance and racism.
</p>
<p class="main">
	A lot of things can happen in a year, so go out and make this year your best yet! Until next year, 
	anyway.
