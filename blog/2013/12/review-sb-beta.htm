	It's finally here! The Starbound Beta! I have been <em>patiently</em> waiting for this ever since
	the moment I found out about it, last year. As soon as I possibly could, I preordered it from 
	their website. And now I have it, inside my ginormous Steam library. I felt giddy when I was 
	downloading it. It literally felt like my life was leading up to this p - wait a minute, am
	I reviewing it, or giving you my life story?
</p>
<p class="main">
	As you might have guessed, I am a big fan of sandbox games, especially ones like Minecraft. 
	The satisfaction that comes with the way you can shape the world and the entire story around what 
	you want is something that only video games have the power to do. 
	<strong>This is a beta</strong>, and I am reviewing it as such. Everything I have outlined here 
	is subject to change, and if you want it <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/211820">
	for yourself</a>, expect character wipes, balance issues and inconveniences.
</p>
<p class="main">
	<a href="http://playstarbound.com">Starbound</a> is an sci-fi open-world sandbox game made by 
	Chucklefish, a game publisher and developer company from the UK. You have left your homeworld, 
	and have crash landed on an alien planet. This is where your story begins. The gameworld revolves 
 	around an entire universe of unique, procedurally generated planets which you can visit and beam 
  	down to with your spaceship.
</p>
<p class="main">
	The reason I am so hyped about it is because of the mind-boggling level of variety and randomness 
	you can play with - every NPC is generated randomly, the planet's colour scheme, dangers, dungeons 
	and monsters are all random as well. Every planet is a new experience! The randomness is done 
	extremely well, but monsters can sometimes fall into patterns, looking similar on many planets.
</p>
<p class="main">
	Combat is currently being constantly tweaked, but mostly feels solid. At the moment, damage 
	and weapons are confusing, to say the least. I found it highly irritating that all of the cool 
	weapons that I found in a dungeon is blown out of the water by relatively rubbish-looking 
	weapons I made myself. Balancing issues are a big negative on this early beta stage - bosses 
	feel ridiculously unfair, and one-shotting enemies while getting one-shotted yourself feels 
	wrong.
</p>
<p class="main">
	As for pre-generated structures, the rarity and variety are very balanced. There can be secret 
	research facilities, ancient tombs, pirate traders, and so much more. It is easily one of the 
	best portions of the entire game. The towns have dialogue and population, which is very welcome.
</p>
<p class="main">
	Much of this game revolves around aquiring resources and crafting things. There isn't as much 
	content as I'd like there to be - but it is early beta. What there is though, that is 
	astonishing. There are 10 tiers, each of which introduces more weapons, armor, ores, monsters 
	and furniture. Resource collection can be tedious at many times, especially as there aren't as 
	many expansive caves as, say Minecraft. 
</p>
<p class="main">
	For atmosphere and story, there is a lot to love. There are six playable races, and each has 
	their own unique characteristics and backstory. For example, there are the Apex, which are a 
	highly advanced ape civilization who seem to be living in a world reminiscent of <em>1984</em>. 
	When you enter a town, there are many different snippets of lore hidden around, which can be 
	added to your codex. Each entry is interesting to read and explore the world of Starbound.
</p>
<p class="main">
	The visuals remind me of Terraria, especially the cross-section 2D wall and block perspective. 
	Overall, everything is given a sci-fi touch. What I did find disappointing is that the tools and 
	weapons that you use are very basic and primitive for a long portion of the game. I want space 
	lasers and guns, not pickaxes and swords!
</p>
<p class="main">
	The soundtrack really sets the scene of "alone in space", and is extraordinary in the way it 
	makes you feel. All of the tracks feel just right. The sounds for monsters are indeed generated 
	as well.
</p>
<p class="main">
	In summary, Starbound is simply brilliant for the scale and theme that it will constantly 
	absorb you in. Even in early beta stage, it has been worked on for a long time by a very 
	dedicated group of people who have made a great replayable experience. At times, the content 
	can feel lacking, and the theme may not be bolstered well by the equipment you use. I would 
	highly recommend you pick this up and give it a go, even if you might wait for a more solid 
	release.
