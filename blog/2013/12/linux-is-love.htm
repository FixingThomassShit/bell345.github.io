	It's been nearly a week since I made a blog post. Let's see what the hell I've done 
	since then. I've installed Ubuntu on my school laptop, we got a new clown car and I 	
	missed a helluva lot of school.

	I can say this right off the bat: Linux is absolutely amazing. It has a great 
	community, an insane amount of security and innovation and a counter-intuitive 
	interface (which I oddly love). In fact, I'm writing this blog post on Ubuntu 
	right now! I have experimented before with Linux in the past, but I had no 
	idea what to do and nothing worked. When I tried it this time, however, one of 
	the first things I did was update everything - and then I instantly fell in love 
	with it.

<p class="main">
	Ubuntu doesn't install new applications from a file on the internet - it instead 
	uses repositories, which contain all of the safe programs available for use at 
	any time. This means that Ubuntu has no viruses, and you don't download 
	suspicious .exe files from a random website - you go on the Software Center and 
	search for it.
</p>
<p class="main">
	Although I do want to go on and on about Linux (oh, did I mention it's completely
	<strong>free</strong>?), I better get on to some other stuff. Due to our constant
	car troubles, I haven't been the best in attendance. I've missed Monday and 
	Thursday (incidentally, are both days which I have PE) and Friday. I'm not 
	proud of it, and this entire situation. But to more happier news - we got 
	a new car! Yay!
</p>
<p class="main">
	You might be asking, "what car did you get?" We got an ancient Susuki Alto for 
	about two grand! Mind you, I was not expecting a Rolls-Royce, but this car 
	is so small and cheap, to me it is goddamn hilarious! I was laughing for a 
	straight hour when I looked at that car. It looked like it came from the Soviet 
	Union, it was so small!
</p>
<p class="main">
	Aside from all of that, I didn't do much. I am very much looking forward to 
	December, and can you believe that it's going to be freaking 2014 next month?
