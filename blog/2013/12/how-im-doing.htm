	I haven't made a blog post in a while - never mind that I'm tired as crap - 
	I'm going to make one now.
</p>
<p class="main">
	First of all: holidays! Fuck to the yes. An entire month of zero responsibility, 
	very late nights and above all, lots and lots of gaming. I have quite the library 
	to keep me occupied - <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/259080">JC2-MP</a>, 
	<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/211820">Starbound</a> and a ton of others 
	which I probably never play.
</p>

	Christmas is around the corner as well. As you get older, you start to stop asking 
	for presents and you start to just get money. Here is what I'm going to spend it on:
</p>
	<ul class="main">
		<li>Games on the Steam sale</li>
		<li>A few subscriptions I've been meaning to get (spotify)</li>
		<li>Donate to some companies who I think deserve it</li>
	</ul>
<p class="main">
	That's about it, really. Christmas sort of loses its charm as you grow up. Soon enough, 
	I'll actually <em>want</em> socks for Christmas.
</p>
<p class="main">
	And finally, 2014. This year felt like the fastest yet - my first year of high school. 
	Don't exactly know why it went so fast! I've definitely improved myself a lot this 
	year - evaluating on those Tumblr posts I made in January and comparing them to now 
	helped. I really didn't realise I was so full of myself and unfunny I was. High school 
	really opened me up to a whole new world of opportunities, education and friends which 
	I had never seen before.
<p class="main">
	My Year In Review is going to be coming sometime next month (should I say next <em>year</em>?). 
	Until then, I have the rest of my advent calendar to get through! Have a good holidays and a great 
	New Year.
