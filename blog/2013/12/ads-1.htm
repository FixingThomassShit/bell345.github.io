	Advertising is one of the most controversial online topics ever since people made 
	money off of them. Many people actively despise online ads, while others heavily 
	rely on them for their wellbeing. It has been quite a cultural phenomenon which 
	has been impacting on the Western world for quite some time.

<p class="main">
	Back in the late 1940s and 1950s, the world was recovering from the financial, 
	emotional, politcal and physical turmoil of World War II. There were sparks for 
	an ideological clash that came to be known as the Cold War. To help the Western 
	world lead the way, the US had an ace up its sleeve - consumerism.

<p class="main">
	Capitalism gave money extreme power in many facets of everyday life, and that 
	meant that people wanted more of it. So companies decided to take this 
	opportunity by opting not for honesty and appeal, but rather persuasive 
	techniques and sketchy marketing to make citizens spend a whole lot more.
</p>
<p class="main">
	This in turn allowed the US government to put large amounts of money and 
	resources to pull the West up by its bootstraps. The Marshall Plan gave 
	a huge quantity of aid and cash to their Allies, and the population were 
	now started to be swayed to different sides by marketers and advertisers.
</p>

	Of course, this meant that Americans went on to pick unwavering opinions on 
	things that they should have had more control over. The cultural and political 
	landscape was no longer populated with honesty and choice, but rather dominated 
	by persuasion and illusion.

	Fast forward to the 1990s. The World Wide Web was yet to become an integral part 
	of our lives. Free software movements, niches and subcultures all started to shape 
	online lives everywhere. Advertising came online.

	Along with the freedoms and joy that came with hyperconnectivity, malicious people 
	could also reach a larger audience. Some unwilling and gullible people became victims 
	of malware attacks through untrustworthy advertisements. This trend continued well 
	into the 2000s, and made many people doubt and distrust advertisements.
</p>
<p class="main">
	Online ads were mainly utilised by big companies who could spread content to a wide 
	audience, and in turn advertisements. These ads are in a spot that the advertisers 
	know will reach many, many people, so they pay lots of money for those positions. 
	As an example of how advertising can affect individuals, enter YouTube - a platform 
	for the creation of ideos on the Internet - and its buyout from Google. Google was 
	only beginning to establish itself as a technology giant, but they offered extremely 
	efficient monetisation services through advertising.

<p class="main">
	Anybody could make regular footage for real cash money by putting ads on their videos. 
	People now even make livings off of these services. To help protect themselves and their 
	content from harm, some signed on with networks called "partners", who provided protection 
	in exchange for a cut of the ad revenue.
</p>
<p class="main">
	Many believe that the Internet should be as free as possible, and that means not using 
	potentially untrustworthy ads on their websites - rather relying on donations from visitors. 
	These people are often highly regarded, as they are working for little to no pay to make the 
	world a better place. Others cannot go down this route, and are forced to need ads plastered 
	on the site to fund themselves.
</p>
<p class="main">
	A controversial point raised would be ad-blockers - extensions for a web browser which 
	automatically hides advertisements which could be dangerous. Most of the time, this prevents 
	people from earning money on these ads, which then harms their budget.

	Well, that was fun to write! Unfortunately I have to stop here, as I need to go to sleep now. 
	Part 2 will be coming soon. Until then, have a safe and happy holidays!
