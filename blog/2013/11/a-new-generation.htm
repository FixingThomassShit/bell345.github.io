    As many may know, the PlayStation 4 has been released in North America. 
    Soon, the Xbox One will be released worldwide, and a week after that, the 
    PS4 will release worldwide. The PlayStation is a series of consoles that has 
    existed ever since 1995 when Sony, previously a manufacturer of electrical 
    appliances, released their video game console to the world and has thrived 
    ever since. The Xbox was developed my Microsoft in 2000, as a venture into the 
    home console market. It got its current name from a development name, the 
    DirectX Box, that evolved into the platform we know today. </p><p class="main">
    A video game console is quite a large investment, and even more so if you plan 
    on getting one on launch day. The one you choose is also a possible dilemma - 
    the PS4 is highly geared toward gaming, and has an excellent style and track 
    record, while the XB1 is renowned for the Xbox Live online service, and the 
    unique exclusive games coming soon. </p><p class="main">
    There is always going to be a big line at release day for both consoles, but 
    many buyers will choose to lay back and wait for a price drop or more games 
    to come out. Then there is always the PC - top of the line for graphics and 
    extensibility - which will certainly keep some behind. As we step into a new 
    era of interactive entertainment, it is certainly a buyer's market.
