    YouTube is a brlliant platform, no doubt about it. It has brought together people and creators 
    from across the globe to converse and share and learn. Many people make a living from ad revenue 
    on their videos. But Google is set to ruin the platform as a whole, and the new comment system is 
    a sign of that. </p><p class="main">
    In case you have been living underneath a rock for the past couple of weeks, YouTube has changed 
    its comment system to: </p><br />
<ul class="main">
    <li>Include G+ video post comments into video comments</li>
    <li>Removed the character limit</li>
    <li>Allowed links to be embedded into comments</li>
    <li>Require a G+ account to post video comments</li>
</ul><br />
<p class="main">
    This has effectively decreased the already abysmal comment quality even further. Spammers can 
    dramatically increase the length of their pointless messages and people looking to give others 
    a hard time can disguise links to take them to a page like a screamer, or a malware/phishing 
    site, for example. </p><p class="main">
    Google is already forcing to use our Google+ accounts (which not many people use) for YouTube, 
    and those who are opposed to G+ will have to deal with it. Disenchanted creators are already 
    disabling their comment sections as a sign of protest for the unprecedented change, opting 
    for alternative discussion forums, such as Reddit. </p><p class="main">
    As long as Google is determined to shove Google+ down our poor throats, YouTube will remain 
    a sinking ship for web openess and safe discussion.
