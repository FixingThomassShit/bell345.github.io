    As this website may tell, I have been messing around with a lot 
    of different web technologies to test my skills, and learn new ones, 
    but the most recent endeavour has trumped me at the moment - a login 
    system. </p><p class="main">
    All throughout today, I set up a HTML form for logging in to my 
    website - retractable box and all - but the hard part came when I 
    tried to add functionality.
    </p><p class="main">
    I have had to do so many things to even think of getting it working - 
    finding the correct tutorials, installing the right PHP modules, 
    finally finding out how to make a new table in SQL. But that is when I 
    realised that this would be much harder than I ever thought. So I 
    abandoned the project. And I've never felt so relieved.
