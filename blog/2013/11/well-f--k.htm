    For god's sake. This type of stuff just keeps happening to me, doesn't it? 
    You're probably wondering what this is all about. Well, prepare to be amazed.

    Let's start from the beginning. We've never been the luckiest family, but we 
    get by. We've managed to own a Toyota that our mum drives us everywhere in. 
    Unfortunately, over the year, this car has begun to break 
    down in the worst places. And I mean worst places. Middle of the road? Break 
    down. Middle of a bridge? Break down. Middle of an intersection? You better 
    believe it - break down (this is now officially a song). </p><p class="main">
    Whenever the car breaks down, my mum tries to fix it. Usually it involves 
    taking it to a repair guy, paying ridiculous amounts of money to the car 
    mechanics, thinking that it's fixed for a while and then it breaks down 
    again. It has been doing this for a few months constantly. Fantastic.

    So my mum uses our <em>quite frankly</em> annoying neighbour's car. And she 
    has been using that car for that last couple of months. Now guess what. 
    <em>This</em> car just broke down today, in the middle of an intersection. 
    That means two cars in the hole. <em>Great.</em> Now, we might have to 
    resort to public transport, and who knows what is going to happen. 
    Oh well. FML.
