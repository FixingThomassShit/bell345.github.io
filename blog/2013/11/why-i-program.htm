    Programming and coding only recently became a hobby of mine, yet I love every 
    single second of it. Even before I considered programming something I like to 
    do, I always adored computers and programs in general. How did this website 
    animate like this? How does it know what information to get at which time? 
    There were too many questions to count! </p><p class="main">
    I started to code in HTML a month ago, when my class in ICT were making their 
    own websites for a project. Being the eager CS student I was, I immediately 
    got onto learning other stuff, such as CSS. That was when I decided that 
    developing was really rewarding, and that I probably should give it a go.
    </p><p class="main">
    Soon, I catched up with my ICT teacher, who was amazed by my skills and 
    actually let me teach my class some HTML! Despite my poor teaching skills, 
    most of my class now knew my ability, and often called upon me for help with 
    their assignments. </p><p class="main">
    I then became interested in learning scripting, such as JavaScript, and I 
    really took off when it came to learning it. I discovered the joys of 
    programming, at last! Continuing to discover new things to try, I even 
    set up my own web server on my laptop, and showed this to my friends, who 
    thought it was the bee's knees. </p><p class="main">
    After all that, the ICT teacher came to me again, and suggested I go to 
    an extracurricular class called CoderDojo. By then, I had even tried C++. 
    CoderDojo really opened my eyes - there were a lot of people my age, also 
    heavily interested in computer programming. </p><p class="main">
    As for why I still program - I just think that there is so much I can do 
    when I program, and that solving problems with my code is extremely 
    rewarding and fun. It's also one of those fields where you can learn 
    quick from your mistakes. I've always been interested in computers, and 
    now I am heavily investing large amounts of time in them. I reckon that 
    this is a new step in my life.
