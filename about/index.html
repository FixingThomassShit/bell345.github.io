                I am a 13-year-old high school student from Australia. I love technology and everything 
                digital. I browse the internet and procrastinate way more than I need to. I tend to browse 
                <a href="//reddit.com/u/isurvived12">Reddit</a> a lot and code for fun.

            <h1>About the Website</h1>
            <p class="main">
                This website started as a school IT project in mid-late 2013. At the time, we were being taught the 
                basics of HTML coding and how to make a functional website. I had skipped ahead and started learning 
                more on my own, building a more and more impressive website looked towards by peers. Using my coding 
                experience, I took a foray into JavaScript and programming in general. The rest is history.
            </p>

                <img src="/shared/img/01.png" alt="01" class="centered" />

            </figure>
            <p class="main">
                This was my first website. Upon this, I had developed my coding skills and programming basics. After 
                learning how to host the website on a local server (IIS), I setup PHP and added a server-side include 
                system. There consisted of a blog, gaming news page, and a math page, where I wrote my first 
                JavaScript. At this point, I was experimenting with quite a few web technologies including ASP.NET, 
                XML and HTML5.

            <h3 class="main"><a href="javascript:void(0)" id="website2">02</a></h3>
            <figure class="img-viewport" id="wsimg02">
                <img src="/shared/img/02.png" alt="02" class="centered" />
                <figcaption class="centered">Similar in style to 01, but with purpose.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="main">
                Being my first practical website project, it had a proper purpose - it was to be a web technology tutorial 
                site called TBTutorials. This one was also hosted locally, so I had a chance to play around with PHP - 
                even incorporating a file upload feature, effectively turning my computer into a HTTP and FTP server. 
                This one was to be submitted as a task to the IT teacher, so for the final copy of 02, all the absolute 
                links were to be changed; and a few features, most notably PHP, had to be scrapped. This copy was 02Submit. 
                I recieved excellent marks for the website, however was criticised on not following procedure.
            </p>
            <h3 class="main"><a href="javascript:void(0)" id="website3">03</a></h3>
            <figure class="img-viewport" id="wsimg03">
                <img src="/shared/img/03.png" alt="03" class="centered" />
                <figcaption class="centered">The dark industrial style of 03.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="main">
                Now that I had no project I had to hand in, I decided to further my skills by creating another personal website. 
                I didn't have any restrictions, so I started developing quite a few JavaScript prototype things. In addition, 
                a few parts of my website were being run by AJAX. Most important of these was the blog. Around the same time 
                I was playing around with Linux, so I also hosted it on Apache as well as IIS.
            </p>
            <h3 class="main"><a href="javascript:void(0)" id="website4">04</a></h3>
            <figure class="img-viewport" id="wsimg04">
                <img src="/shared/img/04.png" alt="04" class="centered" />
                <figcaption class="centered">Current layout.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="main">
                This is the current revision of the website. The highly industrialised and dark theme of 03 was contrasted by a 
                more minimal and open theme of this website. I continued development on more JavaScript prototypes - one I worked 
                on for a long time would be the countdown widget. Eventually, I heard of GitHub Pages. I moved 04 to the web finally.
